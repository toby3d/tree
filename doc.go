/*
Package tree is a subset of a class of languages called two dimensional
languages.

One dimensional languages assume a one dimensional array of bits with a single
read head moving in order.

Two dimensional languages break those assumptions. There may be multiple read
heads that can move not just on the x axis but on the y axis as well.

Tree Notation is a middle ground that utilitizes ideas from the two dimensional
language world using present day technology.
